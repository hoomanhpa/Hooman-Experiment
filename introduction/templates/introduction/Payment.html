The maximum amount of payout equals 6 €.
The client compares his perceived value of the item with the actual price. So higher price doesn‘t necessarily mean better payout. 
If the client likes the design and the product has a higher perceived value for him than the actual price, you receive a better payment. The logic is explained below:
<br>
For items on the shppoing list:
<br>
If perceived value by customer is higher than the actual price, you get 1 €. 
<br>
If perceived value by customer is equal to the actual price, you get 0.5 €. 
<br>
If perceived value by customer is lower than the actual price, you get 0 €. 
<br>
For items, which are not on the shopping list: 
<br>
If perceived value by customer is higher than the actual price, you get 0.5 €. 
<br>
If perceived value by customer is equal to the actual price, you get 0 €. 
<br>
If perceived value by customer is lower than the actual price, you get -0.5 €.
